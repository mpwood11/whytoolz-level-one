WhyToolz Part I: Foundation - Working with Concrete Data Structures

In this section, you'll implement basic functions that work with lists,
dictionaries, and single values. These functions return concrete data
(not generators), making them easier to understand and debug.

Focus on:
- Understanding function signatures and return types
- Working with Python's indexing and slicing
- Building dictionaries from scratch
- Recursion for nested structures

def identity(x):
    """
    Return the input unchanged.

    While this seems trivial, identity is useful as a default function
    when no transformation is needed.

    Args:
        x: Any value

    Returns:
        The same value unchanged

    Example:
        >>> identity(5)
        5
        >>> identity([1, 2, 3])

    Return the first element of a sequence.

    Args:

        The first element

    Example:
        >>> first([1, 2, 3])
        1
        >>> first("hello")

    Hint: How do you safely get the first element of any iterable?

    Return the second element of a sequence.

    Args:

        The second element

    Example:

    """
    Return the last element of a sequence.

    Args:
        seq: Any iterable sequence

    Returns:

    Example:
        >>> last([1, 2, 3])

    Hint: Can you do this without converting the entire iterable to a list?

    Return the nth element of a sequence (0-indexed).

    Args:

    Example:

def count(seq):

    Count the number of items in an iterable.

    Note: This exhausts the iterable! Unlike len(), this works on
    any iterable including generators.

    Args:
        seq: Any iterable

    Returns:
        The number of items

    Example:
        >>> count([1, 2, 3])
        3
        >>> count(range(10))
        10

    Hint: You'll need to consume the entire iterable to count it.

def frequencies(seq):

    Count the occurrences of each unique item in a sequence.

    Returns a dictionary mapping each unique item to its count.

    Args:
        seq: Any iterable

    Returns:
        Dictionary of {item: count}

    Example:
        >>> frequencies(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a'])

        >>> frequencies([1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1])

def groupby(key, seq):

    Group items in a sequence by the result of a key function.

    Returns a dictionary where keys are the results of calling key(item)
    and values are lists of items that produced that key.

    Args:
        key: Function to compute grouping key for each item
        seq: Iterable to group

    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping keys to lists of items

    Example:

        seq: Sequence to prepend to

    Merge multiple dictionaries into one.

    Later dictionaries take precedence - if the same key appears
    in multiple dicts, the value from the rightmost dict wins.

    Args:
        *dicts: Variable number of dictionaries to merge

    Returns:
        New dictionary with all key-value pairs
